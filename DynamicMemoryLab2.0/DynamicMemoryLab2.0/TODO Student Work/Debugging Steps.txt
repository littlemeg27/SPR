Write your debugging steps and thought process here (This is part of your grade)
Checked all options for dealing with Memory leaks.
Got a few things fix but I think I got it down from 700 to 636
Could not get either Apple Debugging Tool to work.
Also tried seeing about doing it by hand but that didnt work either.
